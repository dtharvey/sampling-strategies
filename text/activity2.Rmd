Suppose you have a mixture with two types of particles: those with and those without an analyte of interest, where the fraction of particles with analyte is $p$. If we sample a set of $n$ particles from this mixture, then the number of particles with analyte follows a binomial distribution with an expected mean, $\mu$, an expected standard deviation, $\sigma$, and an expected relative standard deviation, $\sigma_{rel}$ of

$$\mu = np \quad \quad \quad \sigma = \sqrt{np(1 - p)} \quad \quad \quad \sigma_{rel} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - p}{np}}$$

**Exercise 1**. The figure on the right shows 50 experiments in which $n$ particles are drawn from a binomial distribution where $p$ is the fraction of particles with analyte. The scale on the *y*-axis reports results as a percentage so the scale is independent of $n$. Calculate the expected values for $\mu$, $\sigma$, and $\sigma_{rel}$ if $n = 10$ and $p = 0.50$. How do the experimental results shown in the plot compare to the expected results?  

**Exercise 2**. Leave the sample size at $n = 10$ and adjust $p$ from 0.01 to 0.99. Describe how $p$ affects the results. Adjust $p$ to 0.50 and adjust the sample size from $n = 10$ to $n = 1000$. Describe how $n$ affects the results.

**Exercise 3**. Suppose you have a material to sample where $p = 0.05$. How many particles, $n$, do you need to collect to achieve a relative standard deviation of $\sigma_{rel} = 0.01$? 

**Exercise 4**. There is no easy way to count $n$ particles with accuracy and precision. It is easy, however, to determine the mass of $n$ particles if you know their volume and density. Calculate the mass of your $n$ particles from the previous exercise; assume that the particles are spherical with a radius of 0.025 cm and with a density of 1.2 g/cm^3^.

**Exercise 5**. Large samples are often difficult to work with. Suppose you need to reduce the mass of a single sample from the previous exercise to no more than 0.50 g, by grinding the sample into smaller particles. By how much do you need to reduce the radius of the particles to achieve this?
