<p>The overall uncertainty in an analysis, <span class="math inline">\(e_{analysis}\)</span> is a function of the
standard deviation for sampling, <span class="math inline">\(s_{samp}\)</span>, the standard deviation for the
analytical method, <span class="math inline">\(s_{meth}\)</span>, the
number of samples, <span class="math inline">\(n_{samp}\)</span>, the
number of replicate analyses per sample, <span class="math inline">\(n_{rep}\)</span>, and the confidence interval.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[e_{analysis} = t \times
\sqrt{\frac{s_{samp}^2}{n_{samp}} + \frac{s_{meth}^2}{n_{samp} \times
n_{rep}}}\]</span></p>
<p>The figure on the right shows, in blue italics, those combinations of
<span class="math inline">\(s_{samp}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s_{meth}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_{samp}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(n_{rep}\)</span> (all adjustable using the sliders
and radio buttons) that provide an <span class="math inline">\(e_{analysis}\)</span> that is smaller than a
desired maximum error given a choice of confidence interval.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Explore how the choice of <span class="math inline">\(s_{samp}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s_{meth}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_{samp}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n_{rep}\)</span>, and the confidence interval
affects <span class="math inline">\(e_{analysis}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. The cell for <span class="math inline">\(n_{samp} = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n_{rep} = 1\)</span> contains the string
<code>Inf</code> for all combinations of <span class="math inline">\(s_{samp}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s_{meth}\)</span>, and confidence interval.
<code>Inf</code> means the error is infinite. Why is this?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Set the standard deviations for sampling
and for the method to 1, the maximum error to 2, and the confidence
interval to 95%. Note that the error is 1.24 if you analyze two samples,
five times each, and 1.75 if you analyze five samples, two times each.
Both approaches use 10 measurements. Why are their errors different from
each other?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. For any <span class="math inline">\(s_{samp}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(s_{meth}\)</span>, and confidence interval, there
are many combinations of <span class="math inline">\(n_{samp}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(n_{rep}\)</span> that provide an
acceptable error. Under what conditions might you choose to collect
fewer samples and analyze each more times, and under what conditions
might you choose to collect many samples and analyze each just a few
times?</p>
