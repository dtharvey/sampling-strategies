<p>The goal of a quantitative analysis is to report an analyte’s
concentration with both accuracy and with precision. To evaluate
accuracy we consider systematic errors, such as failing to calibrate an
instrument, and to evaluate precision we consider random errors, such as
the noise in an instrument’s signal. Often overlooked are errors
associated with collecting and processing samples. The photos on the
right help to illustrate the importance of sampling. The upper photo
shows a sample of the acid-base indicator erythrosin B (or EB, for
short). Because EB is unstable in aqueous solutions—which makes it
impossible to prepare and store in solution form—it is dispensed by
combining it with NaCl and shaking to coat the salt crystals. The pile
of EB-coated NaCl in the upper photo appears homogeneous, and, as seen
in the lower photo, it appears reasonably homogeneous even when we zoom
in on the pile.</p>
<p>To analyze the bulk material in the jar for EB we collect samples,
bring them into solution, and measure their absorbance with a
spectrophotometer. Although the analysis is accurate—the experimental
mean for 32 samples is 0.118 %w/w EB compared to a known value of 0.116
%w/w EB—the precision of the analysis—a 95% confidence interval of <span class="math inline">\(\pm 15 \%\)</span>—is surprisingly large. A
careful analysis of the bulk sample allows us to partition the overall
variance into the variance due to the lack of homogeneity between
individual samples, the variance associated with preparing samples for
analysis, and the variance associated with their analysis</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sigma_\text{overall}^2 =
\sigma_\text{sampling}^2 + \sigma_\text{preparing}^2 +
\sigma_\text{analyzing}^2\]</span></p>
<p>Despite the reagent’s appearance of homogeneity, as much as 99% of
the overall variance is due to the lack of homogeneity at the level of
individual samples; that is, the process of collecting samples is the
weakest link in this analysis even though the material looks
homogeneous. In this learning module we consider how we can collect and
process samples to improve accuracy and precision.</p>
