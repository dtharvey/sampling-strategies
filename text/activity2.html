<p>Suppose you have a mixture with two types of particles: those with
and those without an analyte of interest, where the fraction of
particles with analyte is <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. If we
sample a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> particles from
this mixture, then the number of particles with analyte follows a
binomial distribution with an expected mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, an expected standard deviation,
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, and an expected relative
standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{rel}\)</span>
of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu = np \quad \quad \quad \sigma =
\sqrt{np(1 - p)} \quad \quad \quad \sigma_{rel} = \sqrt{\frac{1 -
p}{np}}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. The figure on the right shows 50
experiments in which <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> particles
are drawn from a binomial distribution where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the fraction of particles with
analyte. The scale on the <em>y</em>-axis reports results as a
percentage so the scale is independent of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Calculate the expected values for
<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{rel}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p
= 0.50\)</span>. How do the experimental results shown in the plot
compare to the expected results?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Leave the sample size at <span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span> and adjust <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> from 0.01 to 0.99. Describe how <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> affects the results. Adjust <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to 0.50 and adjust the sample size from
<span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n = 1000\)</span>. Describe how <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> affects the results.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Suppose you have a material to sample
where <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.05\)</span>. How many particles,
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, do you need to collect to
achieve a relative standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{rel} = 0.01\)</span>?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. There is no easy way to count <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> particles with accuracy and precision.
It is easy, however, to determine the mass of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> particles if you know their volume and
density. Calculate the mass of your <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> particles from the previous exercise;
assume that the particles are spherical with a radius of 0.025 cm and
with a density of 1.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 5</strong>. Large samples are often difficult to
work with. Suppose you need to reduce the mass of a single sample from
the previous exercise to no more than 0.50 g, by grinding the sample
into smaller particles. By how much do you need to reduce the radius of
the particles to achieve this?</p>
