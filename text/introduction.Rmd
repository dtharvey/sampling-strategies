<!-- text for introduction -->

The goal of a quantitative analysis is to report an analyte's concentration in a sample with both accuracy (How close is our mean result to the analyte's true concentration?) and with precision (How much variability is there in our results?). To evaluate accuracy and precision, we consider systematic errors that affect accuracy, such as failing to calibrate a spectrometer, and we consider random errors, such as the noise in a spectrometer's signal. Often overlooked are errors associated with collecting samples.

The two photos on the right illustrate the importance of sampling. The upper photo shows a sample of the acid-base indicator erythrosin B (or EB, for short). Because EB is unstable in aqueous solutions---which makes it impossible to prepare and store in solution form---it is dispensed by combining it with NaCl and shaking to coat the salt crystals. The pile of EB-coated NaCl in the upper photo appears homogeneous, and, as seen in the lower photo, it  appears reasonably homogeneous even when we zoom in on the pile. 

To analyze the bulk material for EB, we collect individual sub-samples, bring them into solution, and measure their absorbance with a spectrophotometer. Although the analysis is accurate, the precision is surprisingly large: for this sample, the experimental mean is 0.118 %w/w EB vs. a known value of 0.116 %w/w EB, but with a 95% confidence interval that is 15% of the mean.

A careful analysis of the bulk sample allows us to partition the overall variance into the variance due to the lack of homogeneity between individual sub-samples, the variance associated with preparing sub-samples for analysis, and the variance associated with their analysis

$$\sigma_\text{overall}^2 = \sigma_\text{sampling}^2 + \sigma_\text{preparing}^2 + \sigma_\text{analyzing}^2$$

Despite the reagent's appearance of homogeneity, as much as 99% of the overall variance is due to the lack of homogeneity at the level of individual sub-samples. In this module you will consider and evaluate several strategies for collecting samples to improve accuracy and precision.
