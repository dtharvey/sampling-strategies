#### Source of Data

The values in each of the sampling grid's 324 cells are generated anew with each change in the number of sampling sites or the number of replicates. Values are created using `R`'s `rnorm()` function, which draws samples at random from a normal distribution defined by its mean and its standard deviation. For the first stratum (columns 1--3) the mean is 55 and the standard deviation is 12; for the second stratum (columns 4--9) the mean is 28 and the standard deviation is 3.0; and, for the third stratum (columns 10--18) the mean is 9 and the standard deviation is 1.7. The overall mean and standard deviation for all 324 cells is 23 and 17, respectively.

#### Finding the Overall Mean and Standard Deviation for Stratafied Sampling

In our consideration of stratified sampling, each stratum was sampled proportionally, which makes it easy to calculate an overall mean. Using the description above regarding the true mean values for the three strata, and assuming, for simplicity, that each individual sample's value equals its mean, then a proportional stratified sampling using samples of size 9:18:27 gives an overall mean of

$$\frac{(55 \times 9) + (28 \times 18) + (9 \times 27)}{9 + 18 + 27} = \frac{1242}{54} = 23$$

In equal-size stratified sampling, each stratum is sampled an equal number of times. Because the individual strata are not equal in size, each stratum's average result is weighted by a factor equal to the fraction of all sites belong to that stratum. For example, if we sample each stratum 12 times, then the overall mean is

$$\frac{(55 \times 54) + (28 \times 108) + (9 \times 162)}{324} = \frac{7452}{324} = 23$$

#### Other Sampling Strategies

A random sampling of the whole grid, or a proportional random sampling of individual strata are not the only options. There are other sampling strategies, two of which are illustrated on the right. In a systematic sampling, we use a repeating pattern to ensure that an equal number of samples are drawn from each section of the sampling grid; in this case, for example, each of the four main quadrants---defined by the heavy black lines---has 11 samples. 

In judgmental sampling, we use prior knowledge of the site to help guide where we collect samples. For example, when monitoring a hazardous waste storage site for leakage, we might focus most of our samples in that part of the grid adjacent to the source of waste---in this case, the southwest corner of the sampling grid---and then collect additional samples in a pattern that will allow us to identify if a broader spread of the waste has occurred. 

Another strategy for acquiring samples is convenience sampling, in which the ease of obtaining samples is used to make decisions about where to sample and where to not sample. An example of where convenience sampling is necessary is when access to private property prevents you from acquiring a sample.
