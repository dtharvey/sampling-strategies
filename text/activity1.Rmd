An important tool for sampling is a grid that divides the bulk sample into smaller units from which we draw individual samples. The basic sampling grid on the right has 324 cells arranged in 18 rows and 18 columns that represent spatial or temporal information. The controls above the grid allow you to choose the type of sample to collect---random or proportional stratified---and how many sites to sample.

**Exercise 1**. Use the pop-up menu to select a random sampling in which every site is equally likely to be selected. Use the slider to change the number of sites to sample. The mean and standard deviation for these samples are reported above the grid and individual results appear in the grid both numerically and visually. How are the mean and standard deviation affected by the number of sites you sample? What is your best estimate for the mean and the standard deviation across all 324 sites?

**Exercise 2**. Did you notice that the sample grid is divided into three types of results? Sites in the first three columns have a high concentration of analyte, sites in the last nine columns have a low concentration of analyte, and samples in the other six columns have an intermediate concentration of analyte. We call these groups strata. In a proportional stratified sampling, we divide the grid into two or more strata and sample random sites from within each stratum. The slider sets the number of samples for the smallest of the strata. When the slider is set to 3, how many samples are collected from each stratum? Why do these numbers make sense?

**Exercise 3**. For a proportional stratified sampling, the mean and standard deviation of the strata are reported above the grid, and the overall mean is reported below the grid. What is your best estimate for the mean and the standard deviation across all 324 sites? How do the overall mean and standard deviation compare to a random sampling?

**Exercise 4**. For a proportional stratified sampling, set the number of sites to 10 and show that the individual means for the three strata are consistent with the overall mean.
