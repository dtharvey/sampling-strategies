Another important consideration is the number of samples to collect, $n_{samp}$. If the results of an analysis are normally distributed, then the confidence interval due to sampling uncertainty, $s_{samp}$, is
$$\mu = \bar{X} \pm \frac{ts_{samp}}{\sqrt{n_{samp}}}$$
Rearranging and defining the sampling error, $e$, as $\left| \mu - \bar{X} \right|$ gives $n_{samp} = t^2 \times \frac{s_{samp}^2}{e^2}$. The controls on the right allow you to explore how the choice of confidence interval and the maximum number of samples affects the sampling error, $e$, relative to the standard deviation for sampling, $s_{samp}$. A ratio of $1 \times$ means that $e/s_{samp} = 1$, and a ratio of $\times/3$ means that $\frac{e}{s_{samp}} = \frac{1}{3}$.

**Exercise 1**. Suppose you want to ensure that the sampling error, $e$, is no larger than the standard deviation for sampling, $s_{samp}$. For each confidence interval, how many samples do you need to collect?

**Exercise 2**. Set the maximum number of samples to 20. For each confidence interval, what is the greatest possible improvement in the sampling error relative to the standard deviation for sampling, and how many samples are needed to achieve this?
