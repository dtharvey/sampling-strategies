<!-- text for activity 2 -->

Did you notice that the sample grid on the previous tab is divided into three different types of results, suggesting three unique types of samples: 54 high concentration sample sites in columns 1--3; 108 intermediate concentration sample sites in columns 4--9; and 162 low concentration sample sites in columns 10--18. We call these strata. If you didn't notice this, go back and take a second look!

In proportional stratified sampling, we draw random samples from each stratum in a way that maintains the relative proportion of the strata, in this case a 54:108:162, or 1:2:3 proportion. For example, if we collect five random samples from the first stratum, then we collect 10 samples from the second stratum, and 15 samples from the third stratum. 

**Exercise 1**. Use the sliders on the upper right to set the number of sites to sample from the first stratum and the number of replicates to draw from each site. The number of sites to sample from the other two strata are set to maintain the 1:2:3 proportion. The mean and standard deviation for each stratum are shown above the sampling grid, and the overall mean across all samples is given below the sampling grid. Describe how changing the number of sites and the number of replicates affects the mean and standard deviation for the individual strata. 

**Exercise 2**. What is your best estimate for the mean of all 342 sample sites based on your results for several stratified samples drawn using this sample grid?

**Exercise 3**. Set the number of sites to 10 and the number of replicates to 5. Show that the individual means for the three strata are consistent with the overall mean.

**Exercise 4**. How do the results for a stratified sampling compare to a random sampling?
