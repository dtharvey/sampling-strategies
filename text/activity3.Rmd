Use the upper set of controls on the right to define the titration of a diprotic weak acid or a diprotic weak base titrand using a strong base or a strong acid titrant. Use the pK slider to set the two p$K$ values for the weak acid or the weak base. In order to span a wide range of concentrations, the sliders for concentration are logarithmic; the titrand's default concentration is $10^{-1} = 0.10 \text{ M}$ and the titrant's default concentration is $10^{-0.7} = 0.2 \text{ M}$. The lower set of controls allow you to determine the range of volumes to include when displaying the titration curve and to select an indicator. The color of the titration curve mimics the indicator's color during the titration. The titration's endpoint is defined here as the average of its acidic and basic limits.

**Exercise 1**. Describe the effect of the titrand's two p$K_a$ or p$K_b$ values, its concentration and its volume, and the titrant's concentration on the shape and position of the titration curve along the *x*-axis and the change in pH at each of its two equivalence points. Not all combinations of these variables yield a useful titration curve: it is easy to overshoot a titration's equivalence point if it requires just a few mL of titrant, and a titration becomes tedious if the equivalence point requires a large volume of titrant, so make note of limitations on the variables relative to each other. Are the effects the same when titrating a weak acid and titrating a weak base?

**Exercise 2**. Which indicators are suitable for a titration of a diprotic weak acid with a strong base using [titrand] = [titrant] = 0.10 M? Are there indicators that are useful across a wider range of concentrations? Repeat for the titration of a diprotic weak base with a strong acid.

**Exercise 3**. When you use an indicator to signal the endpoint, you usually do not record the titration curve itself. In the absence of suitable indicator, then we must record the titration curve by measuring the pH of the titration mixture as we add the titrant. Is the change in pH sufficient to allow you to identify at least one of the equivalence points when [titrand] = [titrant] = 10^-3^ M?

**Exercise 4**. Commercial washing soda is 30--40 %w/w $\ce{Na2CO3}$. Propose a set of conditions---mass of washing soda, molarity and volume of HCl, and acid-base indicator---that will allow you to determine the amount of $\ce{Na2CO3}$ in samples of washing soda when using HCl as a titrant. All titrations should have endpoints between 20.0 mL and 40.0 mL.
