<p>Another important consideration is the number of individual samples
to collect, <span class="math inline">\(n_{samp}\)</span>, from a single
location. If the results of an analysis are normally distributed, then
the confidence interval due the uncertainty in sampling uncertainty,
<span class="math inline">\(s_{samp}\)</span>, is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu = \bar{X} \pm
\frac{ts_{samp}}{\sqrt{n_{samp}}}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. If we define the sampling error, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, as <span class="math inline">\(\left|
\mu - \bar{X} \right|\)</span>, show that the number of samples we need
to collect is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n_{samp} = t^2 \times
\frac{s_{samp}^2}{e^2}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. The controls on the right allow you to
explore how the relationship between the confidence interval and the
maximum number of samples affects the sampling error, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, relative to the standard deviation for
sampling, <span class="math inline">\(s_{samp}\)</span>. A ratio of 1
means that <span class="math inline">\(e/s_{samp} = 1\)</span>, and a
ratio of 1/3 means that <span class="math inline">\(e/s_{samp} =
\frac{1}{3}\)</span>. Suppose you want to ensure that the sampling
error, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, is no larger than the
standard deviation for sampling, <span class="math inline">\(s_{samp}\)</span>; that is, <span class="math inline">\(e/s_{samp} = 1\)</span>. Set the maximum number of
samples to 100. For each of the available confidence intervals what is
the smallest number of samples you need to collect? In the figure on the
right, cells shaded in blue are conditions where the number of samples
needed exceeds the maximum number of samples allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Set the maximum number of samples to 20.
For each confidence interval, what is the greatest possible improvement
in the sampling error relative to the standard deviation for sampling,
and how many samples are needed to achieve this?</p>
